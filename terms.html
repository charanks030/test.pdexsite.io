Polkadex intends to implement a Parachain on the Network using the services or resources of the Network. The Network will support a limited number of Parachains by releasing a fixed number of Parachain slots (“Parachain Slots”), each of which shall have a leasing duration of two (2) years (“Slot Lease Duration”). In case of a successful auction, the Project will be onboarded on the Network and the Contributor will be able to use the Network blockchain during the Slot Lease Duration. These Parachain Slots are competitive in nature, which means many projects including our Project may need to lock a large number of Tokens to secure the slot lease when they’re auctioned off during the Campaign Duration.</p><p>3.2. The intention of the Company solely is to participate in the Network Parachain Auction to secure a Parachain Slot through Auction Bid(s) by submitting the maximum amount of the bids and let the Contributor contribute Tokens or DOT in support of the Company’s Auction Bid(s).</p><p>3.3. The Parachain Slots are secured and won by the Project through a Candle Auction. Once the Contributor has contributed a minimum bid of the Tokens during the Campaign Duration, in the Network Controlled Token Account, from the Contributor’s Digital Wallet, the Tokens will get locked in the Network and the Contributor will not be able to withdraw the Contribution till the Auction ends. In case the Company determines that it has received sufficient Contribution for the Auction Bid, it can at its sole discretion cease the acceptance of any further Contributions.</p><p>3.4. In case of a successful Auction Bid by the Company, the Tokens or DOT contributed by the Contributor will be locked in the Network for the Slot Lease Duration. Only at the end of the Slot Lease Duration, and when the Network automatically releases the contributed Tokens, will the Contributor be able to withdraw the Tokens contributed. The Contributor will be able to withdraw the Contribution made with respect to the Auction Bid, within such period of time as may be specified by the Network, by initiating a transaction using the same unique private key associated with the Digital Wallet from which the Contribution was made.</p><p>3.5. In case the Auction Bid by the Company is unsuccessful, the Company will continue to participate in the next Network Parachain Auction by submitting further Auction Bid(s) until the expiry of the Campaign Duration. The Tokens (including all Supporters’ Contributions) may be released in full automatically by the Network upon the expiry of the Campaign Duration and Contributors will be able to withdraw, within such period of time as may be specified by the Network, Contributor’s respective Contribution from the Network Controlled Token Account by initiating a transaction using the same unique private key associated with the Digital Wallet from which the Contribution was made.</p><p>4. PARACHAIN REWARD PROGRAMME</p><p>4.1. Post the successful completion of the Candle Auction, Polkadex will provide the Contributor 4 with reward tokens known as “PDEX Tokens” for each Token or DOT contributed towards the Project through the Auction Bid (“Reward Programme”). For each Token or DOT contributed towards the auction, the Contributor will receive 2 PDEX Token from the Company as the base reward or any other such amount as may be decided by the Company.</p><p>4.2.

The Contributor shall be eligible to use the PDEX Tokens for the governance of the Project or for future projects of the Company or as the Company may direct the Contributor from time to time.</p><p>4.4.

The factors for determining the distribution of the rewards to the Contributors may be decided by the Company in its sole discretion and may be amended and modified over the Website from time to time. The Company may decide to change the base reward and/or prescribe separate reward amounts for different Contributors as well.</p><p>4.5.
